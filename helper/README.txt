The purpose of this application is for businesses to schedule appointments between customers and consultants.

IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1.1, full JDK of version 11, and JavaFX version compatible with JDK 11-SDK-11-0.11 

After the user logs in, they are prompted to an appointment scheduler where they can create and modify customers and appointments in the US, Canada, or UK. All of the information is then stored in a MySQL database. The user can filter appointments by week, month, or simply view all of the appointments. Lastly, the user can view reports that are generated from the database.

The additional report shows the reports based on the state or province. I chose this report because I believe that it is useful for the consultants if they knew where their customers are from.
